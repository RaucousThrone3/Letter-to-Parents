    <p>
Dear Mom and Dad,
<br>
<br>        
First off, thank you. You have played (and continue to play) a role in my life
like none other. You have known me longer than anyone else (my whole
life!) and in some ways you've known me closer than anyone else (dirty
diapers, temper tantrums, etc.). For all of that and more, thank you.
But more than simply maintaining my existence and cleaning me up
along the way, you have been an essential part of my ongoing spiritual
        formation and development.</p>
        <br>
        <br>        
<h2 style="color:red;">What You Did</h2>
<p style="color:red;">You gave me my first Bible and even sat down to read it with me. You even
showed me where the book of James was. It was my favorite book until I
realized it wasn't named after me. Years later when I was ready to "get
serious" about studying the Bible, you bought me another one (and this one
wasn't cheap, I saw your face when you turned over the box).
You sat by me in church and taught me to participate in the worship
gathering. From turning pages in a hymnal to praying silently and aloud, I
can still recite prayers and creeds and know my way around a liturgy, all
    because of you.
        <br>
        <br>        
We would have family devotions and light advent candles and sing
cheesy songs. You would pray with me nearly every night and let me ask
you any question (including the night where I realized what I felt beneath 
my skinny chest was my sternum, not an upside down heart; what a relief to
a seven-year-old).
        <br>
        <br>
You took me to youth group, starting in 5th grade, and let me go with
friends to their church’s youth group and events. When I was old enough to
drive you let me spend late nights at other Bible studies and church events,
journeying with friends and other adults. And in a non-helicopter-parent
way, you even got to know my friends and the other adults who were
leading youth group and Bible study.
        <br>
        <br>
Throughout all of this, you were there. You empowered my faith and
helped me articulate a language of faith. Whether you knew it or not, you
were the most influential and formative presence in my faith journey. And
you should be proud.</p>
        <br>
        <br>        
        <h3 style="color:yellow;">What I Wish You Did</h3>
<p style="color:yellow;"Looking back on it all, in some ways I wish you had done more.
Eventually our family devotions ended. And as much as I was glad to
be done with the cheesy songs (Seriously Dad, when did you learn them?
Oh yeah, the 60s.) I would have enjoyed structured space to continue
sharing questions. I love to ask mine and I would even have loved to hear
yours! I know the dinner table turned into a fleeting object as my life filled
up with high school activities, but what about car rides together or family
vacations or notes to each other on the fridge? You helped me start my
journey of questioning everything in order to hold onto that which is good.
And looking back, I wish there had been more. (You never know, I may
   have had a thing or two to teach you!)
        <br>
        <br>
We always sat together in church on Sundays, but we never talked
much about what the sermon or the worship gathering. Maybe this is
because we were all so involved in helping out on Sundays that we thought
we would be simply talking about our own thing. But in some ways it felt
like we had a shared spiritual experience each week but then left it at the
door due to the demands of Sunday school classes, church meetings, or
other Sunday events. What would it have looked like to share a “from me to
you” moment each week, pulling the curtain back another inch to reveal the
formation happening within each of us?
        <br>
        <br>
And I know we were always busy working in and with the church, but I
wish we had done more to serve together, both in and out of the church.
What if our family ritual for holidays wasn't to eat food around our table, but
to serve it to those who don't have one? What if we had traveled together,
encountering life-changing and faith-shaping experiences together? The
rituals we had shaped me (and continue to shape me, years later), but what
else could we have done? Something as simple as Sunday morning
breakfast together (which would have required you taking the sports and
comic section away from me) would have helped make this possible.
In so many ways, I value what we had. But in the same breath, I wish
        there had been more.</p>
     <br>
        <br>
<h4 style="color:pink;">Family Style Faith</h4>
<p style="color:pink;">Do not think I am forgetting all the moments in between. I was your typical
teenager and you were the unfair parents (when in reality there is nothing
typical about any teenager and unfair is an unfair label to give any
parent). We had plenty of moments fighting and arguing about cars and
curfews (and even a few arguments about faith). But as I look back now, I
realize now just how much you helped me articulate and express a language
of faith. This is a language I continue to learn and develop today. I could
not have done it alone then and I cannot do it alone today. Thank you for
the role you played and continue to play in my life and my faith.</p>
